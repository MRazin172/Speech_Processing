        "- **Generated Observation Sequence**: `Pitch → Energy → Pitch`\n",

        "#### Key Observations:\n",
        "1. **Phoneme Transitions**:\n",
        "   - The sequence starts with `/s/`, as expected, based on the initial probability of 1.\n",
        "   - The transition from `/s/` to `/ie:/` and subsequently to `/tS/` aligns with the defined transition probabilities. Each transition reflects the probabilistic behavior modeled in the transition matrix.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Observation Emission**:\n",
        "   - The observations (`Pitch`, `Energy`, `Pitch`) were emitted in alignment with the emission probabilities for each phoneme.\n",
        "   - For example, `/s/` emits `Pitch` with a 0.2 probability, and `/ie:/` emits `Energy` with a 0.3 probability. This showcases the probabilistic generation of observable properties based on hidden states.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Interpretation of the HMM's Behavior:\n",
        "- The generated sequences validate that the HMM accurately models the phoneme transitions and their corresponding observations. It captures both the underlying structure of phoneme transitions and the stochastic nature of acoustic property emissions.\n",
        "- The result demonstrates that the HMM can effectively simulate the dynamic behavior of speech processing, making it a suitable model for applications in phoneme recognition, speech synthesis, or automated speech analysis.\n"
